This project will mimic some of the features in [Trello](https://trello.com).

It is built with Ionic and Angular. To get this running on your machine, perform the following steps:

- Install Ionic.
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```
- Checkout the repo.
- Install npm packages
```bash
$ npm install
```
- Start the server
```bash
$ ionic serve
```
- From here you should be able to view the app in a web browser at `localhost:8100`
- To run tests
```bash
$ npm test
```
